- **Project Name**: Forecasting Models
- **Description**: This project demonstrates the use of ARIMA models for time series forecasting using synthetic monthly demand data.
- **Key Features**:
  - Synthetic data generation with trends, seasonality, and noise.
  - Visualization of historical demand data.
  - ARIMA model fitting and forecasting.
  - Plotting historical demand alongside forecasted values.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`
- **How to Run**:
  1. Install required libraries using `pip install matplotlib statsmodels`.
  2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `server_forasting.ipynb`.
  3. Execute the cells sequentially to generate data, fit the ARIMA model, and visualize results.
- **Output**:
  - Historical demand plots.
  - ARIMA model summary.
  - Forecasted demand for the next 6 months.
